## Product Description

The RAK2560 WisNode Sensor Hub is a modular sensor ecosystem consisting of the main body and multiple pre-configured sensor probes. It has pluggable and interchangeable probes and supports third-party sensors integration. These characteristics make the Sensor Hub an ideal and adaptable solution platform for a wide range of IoT applications requiring environmental monitoring.

The Sensor Hub is housed in a robust, waterproof enclosure with two (2) sensor probe ports for connecting sensors or an external power source, such as a solar panel. It can operate with an external power supply or in full battery mode, depending on the deployment location.

With the use of the WisToolBox app, the Sensor Hub and its sensor probes can be easily configured. The application is available on mobile and desktop.
