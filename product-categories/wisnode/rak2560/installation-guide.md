## Mounting of the Sensor Hub

### Wall Mounting

1. Using a 5 mm drill head, drill holes in the wall and plug the screw anchors in the holes.

### Pole Mounting

1. Fix the mounting bracket on the pole with one steel strip.

:::tip NOTE
The diameter of the pole that is supported by the brackets is 50-80 mm. If the pole diameter is more than this value, larger steel strips can be used. The standard mounting kit does not include larger steel strips. If needed, you should purchase them separately.
:::

2. Align the hanging tab of the device with the slot on the bracket, and put the tab into the slot. Then, pull the device down until it clicks in place.

## Connecting Probes to the Sensor Hub

### Connecting the Sensor Probe

You have multiple options, depending on the deployment requirements and available space.

1. Connect the Sensor Probe to the Hub directly by plugging the cable into one of the free ports on the main body.

3. Connect the Probe to the Hub via a splitter cable for the option to connect multiple Probes to the same port of the Hub.

> **Image:** Connection via a splitter

:::tip NOTE
A single port can support a maximum of four (4) Probe IOs or Sensor Probes.
:::

4. Connect the Probe to the Hub using a splitter and extender cable at once for maximum placement freedom.

### Connecting the Probe IO

RAK2560 Sensor Hub can support third-party sensors through the Probe IO.

1. Remove the lid using a Philips screwdriver.

:::tip NOTE
The connection of the wiring terminal depends on the type of sensor it is connected to. Different sensors have different pin connection requirements.
