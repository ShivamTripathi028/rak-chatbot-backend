## Network Server and Visualization Configuration

This section outlines the operational steps for connecting the device to the network server in both the LoRaWAN and NB-IoT application scenarios.

> **Image:** LoRaWAN Application Scenarios

### LoRaWAN Application

#### Cloud Network Server Setup

The cloud network server deployment solution involves connecting the gateways and devices to a third-party cloud network server. This server integrates visualization applications to manage CO<sub>2</sub> Concentration sensor data in real-time.

This section provides instructions on creating a Datacake visualization application using the TTN v3 cloud network server.

> **Image:** Cloud network server deployment solution

##### Connect Gateway to TTN

In this section, the example will use the TTNv3 cloud server and RAK7289 V2 WisGate Edge Lite 2 to demonstrate how to connect the RAK business gateway to a cloud server.

- **Register the Gateway**

1. Register an account and log in to the [TTN v3 website.](https://eu1.cloud.thethings.network/console/) If you already have a TTN account, you can log in with your **The Things ID** credentials.

> **Image:** Log in to the TTN website

2. Once logged into the site, click on **Register a gateway** to begin the registration process for a new gateway. 

> **Image:** TTN home page

3. Input the Gateway EUI and then click on **Confirm** to proceed. 

The Gateway EUI serves as a distinct 64-bit extended identifier for the gateway, accessible from the Overview page of the gateway management platform or from the label situated behind the gateway.

> **Image:** Enter the Gateway EUI

4. Choose the appropriate frequency plan used by the gateway, and click **Register gateway** to complete the registration process of the gateway.

> **Image:** Configure the gateway frequency

**Generate Token**

TTNv3 supports TLS server authentication and client tokens, which require trust files and keys to configure the gateway and successfully connect to the network. 

1. To generate a key file, navigate to **API keys** from the **Overview** page of the registered gateway, then click on **Add API key**.

> **Image:** Add API keys

2. In the **Add API key** page, set the **Name** field, tick of the checkboxes shown in **Figure 8**, then click **Create API key**.

#### Built-In Network Server Setup

The RAK gateway comes with a built-in NS, which eliminates the need to deploy NS in the cloud or locally. This gateway is suitable for small-sized industrial application scenarios and offers various advantages such as cost savings, reduced R&D investment, high execution efficiency, and shorter delays.

The built-in network server of the RAK gateway provides MQTT and HTTP integration that allows for post-processing data and implementing solutions based on the needs.

This section will use the public MQTT broker integration as an example to demonstrate how to use the built-in network server to create a visualization application on ThingsBoard.

> **Image:** Gateway built-in NS application scenario

##### Configure the ThingsBoard

1. Log in to [ThingsBoard.](https://thingsboard.cloud/login) If you don't have an account yet, [create one](https://thingsboard.cloud/signup) before proceeding.

> **Image:** ThingsBoard authentication page

2. After successfully logging in, you will be directed to the ThingsBoard homepage.

5. Enter the name of the decoder in the **Name** field (for example, *Uplink decoder*), leave the **Type** field as **Uplink**, and select the **JavaScript** option.

> **Image:** Add the decoder code

6. Edit the decoder code by copying the following code into the edit box. Then, click **Add** to include the uplink decoder.

````js
/** Decoder **/
// decode payload to string
  var payloadStr = decodeToString(payload);
  var data = JSON.parse(payloadStr).data;
  var bytes = atob(data).split('').map(function(c) {
    return c.charCodeAt(0);
  });

  var values = {};
  let i = 0;
  while (i < bytes.length) {
    var channelId = (bytes[i] << 8) | bytes[i + 1];
    var value;
    if (channelId === 0x157D) {
      value = (bytes[i + 2] * 256 + bytes[i + 3]);
      i += 4;
      values.co2 = value;
    }  else {
      break;
    }
  }

  var integrationName = 'MQTT Integration';
  var deviceName = 'sensorhub_co2';
  var result = {
    deviceName: deviceName,
    attributes: {
      integrationName : metadata[' integrationName '],
co2: values.co2,},
};

/** Helper functions **/

function decodeToString (payload) {
