## Solution Description

The Sensor Hub CO<sub>2</sub> Concentration Monitoring solution comprises the RK300-03, and the Sensor Hub. This solution incorporates advanced infrared absorption gas detection technology and it is widely used in various fields and locations requiring CO<sub>2</sub> concentration detection, such as air quality monitoring, greenhouses, smart homes, schools, and industrial production.

With the plug-and-play feature of the Sensor Hub, the CO<sub>2</sub> Concentration Monitoring solution comes with pre-installed components ready for easy installation and connection. The sensor provides highly accurate CO<sub>2</sub> Concentration readings, with the Sensor Hub collecting and transmitting the data via LoRaWAN or NB-IoT/CAT M1.

The Sensor Hub’s connectivity function allows for versatile data transmission to the cloud using the two most commonly used communication protocols in IoT. This versatility ensures that data is readily available for storage, visualization, and in-depth analysis, enabling informed decision-making based on comprehensive knowledge of CO<sub>2</sub> levels.
