#### Sensor Characteristics

The following table shows the sensor data definition and the data format of the CO<sub>2</sub> Concentration Solutions.

- **Sensor Data Definitions**

| Sensor Name                  | Sensor Type | Data Length | Range  | Unit |
|------------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------|------|
| CO<sub>2</sub> Concentration | 0x7D        | 2           | 0~5000 | ppm  |

- **Data Format**

| ID (Channel) | Type   | Data    |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| 1 Byte       | 1 Byte | 2 Bytes |

With the defined data, here's how to interpret the payload received data:

- **Data Example**

Payload (hexadecimal) received data is: `15 7d 02 AA`

| ID (Channel) | Type | Data |
|--------------|------|------|
| 15           | 7D   | 02AA |

`157D` (CO<sub>2</sub> concentration) - `02AA` (Data)

Convert the value to decimal:

````
02 AA (hex) = 682 (10 dec)
682 × 1 (conversion coefficient) = 682 ppm

##### Storage Requirements

Store the module in a partially charged state, typically around 40% state of charge (SOC). Ensure the storage environment meets the following requirements:

**Temperature and Humidity**

| Parameter   | Description                                              | Remark                                              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Temperature | -30° C to 50° C  
 0° C to 25° C | Time period < 3 months 
 Time period > 3 months |
| Humidity    | 2 %RH to 90 %RH                                | < 85 % Recommended                             |

- **Storage Environment**: Store the product in a clean, ventilated, and cool environment, avoiding direct sunlight, high temperatures, corrosive gases, severe vibration, mechanical shaking, and heavy pressure. Keep the product away from heat sources and store it at an altitude below 1500 meters, maintaining atmospheric pressure between 86 kPa and 106 kPa.

- **Maintenance**: Charge and discharge the device once a month while storing it at room temperature or in a dry and ventilated environment. If storing the device takes more than 30 days, adjust the SOC to 40 % after charging. If the module is expected to be stored for more than 30 days, adjust the State of Charge (SOC) to 40 % after charging is completed.

The operation of the product must adhere to the provided operating instructions. Installation, maintenance, and usage of this product must strictly comply with relevant safety regulations.

:::warning
-	Avoid storing or using the product in high-temperature environments, and keep it away from heat sources. Temperatures outside the safe range can significantly reduce the performance and lifespan of the product, and may even cause serious consequences such as combustion and explosion.
-	Do not store or use the product in environments with high static electricity or high electromagnetic radiation. Doing so may damage the electronic components of the battery, leading to safety hazards.
-	Avoid exposing the battery to water or immersing it in water. Otherwise, it may result in internal short circuits, loss of function, or abnormal chemical reactions, leading to fire, smoke explosion, and other incidents.
-	If you notice any smoking, heating, discoloration, deformation, or any other abnormalities during the use, storage, transportation, and service of the product, contact a professional immediately for assistance.
-	Do not discard waste batteries in fires or incinerators. Waste batteries should be recycled by professional institutions or organizations.
-	It is strictly prohibited to place heavy objects on the product or stack them on top of each other.
-	Although this module is not a high-voltage energy storage device, improper operation and use of the device may lead to serious consequences such as combustion and explosion. 
-	Only professional technicians must handle the installation and maintenance of the battery system. All operations must strictly adhere to relevant safety regulations. Non-professionals are strictly prohibited from installing, maintaining, and misusing the battery system.
