## Product Description

The RAK7204 WisNode Sense Home is an LPWAN node with integrated environmental sensors. The high-precision environmental sensors can measure changes in temperature, humidity, and air pressure and provide an indoor air quality index. All the accumulated data can be sent to a gateway and forwarded to the cloud.

The environmental sensors, LoRa transceiver module, LoRa antenna, and battery are fitted in a 90&nbsp;mm x 85&nbsp;mm x 34&nbsp;mm sized housing. These small dimensions allow for installation in tight spaces or those that require the sensor to have a minimal impact on the overall feel of the surrounding environment. The housing adopts a hollow, permeable design to facilitate airflow in order to more accurately detect environmental changes.
