# Water pH Monitoring Solution Datasheet

## Solution Overview

### Description

The Water pH Sensor Solution integrates the RAK Sensor Hub with the JXBS-4001-pH Water pH Sensor. The probe features a pH glass electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, ensuring stable signals and high precision. This sensor offers a wide measuring range, good linearity, excellent waterproof performance, and is both easy to use and install.

With the plug-and-play feature of the Sensor Hub, the Water pH Sensor Solution comes with pre-installed components ready for easy installation and connection. The sensor provides highly accurate water pH readings, with the Sensor Hub collecting and transmitting the data via LoRaWAN or NB-IoT/CAT M1.

The Sensor Hub’s connectivity function allows for versatile data transmission to the cloud using the two most commonly used communication protocols in IoT. This versatility ensures that data is readily available for storage, visualization, and in-depth analysis, enabling informed decision-making based on comprehensive knowledge of water pH levels.

#### Sensor Characteristics

The following table shows the sensor data definition and the data format of the water pH solution.

- **Sensor Data Definitions**

| Sensor Name | Sensor Type | Data Length | Range | Unit            |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| Water pH    | 0x15        | 2           | 0-14  | pH              |

- **Data Format**

| ID (Channel) | Type   | Data    |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| 1 Byte       | 1 Byte | 2 Bytes |

With the defined data, here's how to interpret the payload received data:

- **Data Example**

Payload (hexadecimal) received data is: `15 C1 04 3E`

| ID (Channel) | Type | Data |
|--------------|------|------|
| 15           | C1   | 043E |

`15C1` (Water pH) - `043E` (Data)

Convert the value to decimal:

````
04 3E (hex) = 1086 (dec)
1086 × 0.01 (conversion coefficient) = 10.86 pH
````

#### Environmental Requirements
