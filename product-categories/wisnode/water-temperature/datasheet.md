# Water Temperature Monitoring Solution Datasheet

## Solution Overview

### Description

The Water Temperature Monitoring Solution is built with RAK Sensor Hub and JXBS-3001-SW-RS Water Temperature Sensor. This comprehensive monitoring system is well-suited for various applications, including cold storage, pharmaceutical factory GMP monitoring, and HVAC systems.

With the plug-and-play feature of the Sensor Hub, the Water Temperature Monitoring Solution comes with pre-installed components ready for easy installation and connection. The sensor provides highly accurate water temperature readings with the Sensor Hub collecting and transmitting the data via LoRaWAN or NB-IoT/CAT M1.

The Sensor Hub’s connectivity function allows for versatile data transmission to the cloud using the two most commonly used communication protocols in IoT. This versatility ensures that data is readily available for storage, visualization, and in-depth analysis, enabling informed decision-making based on comprehensive knowledge of water temperature levels.

#### Sensor Characteristics

The following table shows the sensor data definition and the data format of the Water Temperature Monitoring Solution.

- <b>Sensor Data Definitions</b>

| Register Name     | Function Code | Register Address | Data Length | Sensor Code | Unit     | Resolution   | Range             | Precision |
|-------------------|---------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|----------|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Water Temperature | 0x03          | 0x0000           | 2           | 0x67        | °&nbsp;C | 0.01°&nbsp;C | -55 ~ 125°&nbsp;C | 0.1       |


- <b>Data Format</b>

| Sensor Data Unit  | ID (Channel) | Type   | Data    |
|-------------------|--------------|--------|---------|
| Water Temperature | 1 Byte       | 1 Byte | 2 Bytes |


With the defined data, here's how to interpret the payload received data:

<b>Data Sample 1:</b><br/>

Payload (hex) received data: `156700fc`

| Sensor Data Unit  | ID (Channel) | Type | Data |
|-------------------|--------------|------|------|
| Water Temperature | 15           | 67   | 00fc |


Convert the sensor data from hexadecimal to decimal:

- **Wind Speed**: `1567`
- **Data**: `00fc`

```
00fc (hex) = (0 × 16³) + (0 × 16²) + (15 × 16¹) + (12 × 16⁰) = 252₁₀
252 x 0.01 (conversion factor) = 25.2° C
```


#### Environmental Requirements

##### Transportation Requirements

:::warning
- When transporting the battery, avoid severe vibrations, shaking, and exposure to sunlight or rain. 
- Do not invert the battery to prevent potential short circuits. 
- During loading and unloading, exercise caution to prevent the battery from falling, rolling, enduring heavy pressure, or being inverted.
:::

##### Storage Requirements

Store the module in a partially charged state, typically around 40 % state of charge (SOC). Ensure the storage environment meets the following requirements:

- **Storage Environment**: Store the product in a clean, ventilated, and cool environment. Avoid direct sunlight, high temperatures, corrosive gasses, severe vibration, mechanical shock, and heavy pressure. Keep it away from heat sources and store below 1,500&nbsp;meters altitude, with the atmospheric pressure between 86&nbsp;kPa and 106&nbsp;kPa.

- **Maintenance**: Charge and discharge the device once a month while storing it at room temperature or in a dry and ventilated environment. If storing the device takes more than 30 days, adjust the SOC to 40&nbsp;% after charging.

The operation of the product must adhere to the operating instructions. Installation, maintenance, and use of the product must strictly comply with relevant safety regulations.

:::warning
- Avoid storing or using the product in high-temperature environments and keep it away from heat sources. Temperatures outside the safe range can significantly reduce the performance and lifespan of the product and may even cause serious consequences such as combustion and explosion. 
- Do not store or use the product in environments with high static electricity or high electromagnetic radiation. Doing so may damage the electronic components of the battery, leading to safety hazards.
- Avoid exposing the battery to water or immersing it in water. Otherwise, it may result in internal short circuits, loss of function, or abnormal chemical reactions, leading to fire, smoke explosion, and other incidents.
- If you notice any smoking, heating, discoloration, deformation, or any other abnormalities during the use, storage, transportation, and service of the product, contact a professional immediately for assistance.
- Do not discard waste batteries in fires or incinerators. Waste batteries should be recycled by professional institutions or organizations.
- It is strictly prohibited to place heavy objects on top of the product or stack them on top of each other. 
- Although this module is not a high-voltage energy storage device, improper operation and use of the device may lead to serious consequences such as combustion and explosion. 
- Only professional technicians must handle the installation and maintenance of the battery system. All operations must strictly adhere to relevant safety regulations. Non-professionals are strictly prohibited from installing, maintaining, and misusing the battery system.
