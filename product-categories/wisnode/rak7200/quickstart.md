### Connecting to the Helium Network

Helium has quickly become the most widespread LPWAN communal network with more than 27,000 devices deployed globally. All the RAKwireless node products are compatible with it and the process of adding a device to the network is intuitive and straightforward.

This section will focus on giving a brief guide on how to connect the RAK7200 to the network console, assuming that there is a Helium Hotspot within range.

Log in or create your account in the [Helium console page](https://www.helium.com/console).


<RkImage
  src="https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/1.helium-console.png"
  width="85%"
  caption="Helium console"
/>

Once registered/logged in, you will end up at the home page where you can see your function tree on the left and your DC balance at the top, as well as several useful links.


<RkImage
  src="https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/2.home.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Helium console home screen"
/>

Go to the **Devices** section in the function tree. If this is your first time doing this, there will be no devices registered. Click the **+ Add Device** button to get started.


<RkImage
  src="https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/3.device-section.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Devices section"
/>

A window will pop up with a set of a field containing the device parameters required for its registration.

<RkImage
  src="https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/4.add-device.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Adding a new device"
/>

Fill in a name of your choosing. The **Dev EUI**, **App EUI**, and **App Key** will have random values generated for you by default. Press the eye icon to reveal the values. You can manually replace them with values of your own. For this tutorial, use the default values. Press the **Submit** button, and you are done.

<RkImage
  src="https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/5.registered-device.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Helium devices"
/>

Now, your RAK7200 is registered and is awaiting activation. For this to happen, you need to import the Dev EUI, App EUI, and App Key in the RAK7200 using the [RAK Serial Port Tool](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/Tools/RAK_SERIAL_PORT_TOOL_V1.2.1.zip).

Open the tool, select the desired port (default baud rate) and open it. Then start importing your settings.

Configure your LoRa band and activation mode. This tutorial will be using the EU868 band and OTAA (the only option available for now with Helium) with device class A (default one, does not need configuring).

- Regional band and activation mode setting


```
at+set_config=lora:join_mode:0
```

```
at+set_config=lora:region:EU868
```

- Enter the Dev UI

Use the command below by replacing the XXXX with your Device EUI from the Helium console:


```
at+set_config=lora:dev_eui:XXXX
```

- Enter the App EUI

The same as with the Device EUI, replace the XXXX with your value:

```
at+set_config=lora:app_eui:XXXX
```

- Enter App Key

Finally, fill in the App key with the following command:

```
at++set_config=lora:app_key:XXXX
```

- Join Network

Finish executing the join command in order for the node to initiate the join procedure. Once the procedure is initiated and successfully complete, you will have a notification in the serial console.

```
at+join
```

<RkImage

#### LoRaWAN Join Mode

In LoRaWAN, there are two ways a node can connect itself to the LoRaWAN network. This is referred to as **Join Mode**. LoRaWAN allows the OTAA mode and the ABP mode. In this section, the configuration process of these two modes, both on the platform side and the node side will be explained.

##### OTAA Mode

###### Configure the OTAA Mode on the Platform

1. If you have selected **DeviceProfile_OTAA** as shown in **Figure 41**, then after the device is created, an Application Key must be also created for this device.

<RkImage
  src="https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/43.otaa.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack OTAA Activation"
/>

2. A previously created Application Key can be entered here, or a new one can be generated automatically by clicking the icon highlighted in red in **Figure 42**:

<RkImage

  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack OTAA Set Application Keys"
/>

3. Once the Application Key is added in the form, the process can be finalized by clicking on the **SET DEVICE-KEYS** button.

* As shown in **Figure 43**, a new device should be listed in the DEVICES tab. The most important parameters, such as the Device EUI are shown in the summary.

<RkImage
  src="https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/45.list-device.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack OTAA List of Device"
/>

4. To end the process, it is a good practice to review that the Application Key is properly associated with this device. The Application Key can be verified in the **KEYS(OTAA)** tab as shown in **Figure 44**.

<RkImage
  src="https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/46.application-key.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack OTAA Set Application Key"
/>

:::tip NOTE

Standard OTAA mode requires the **Device EUI**, **Application Key**, and the **Application EUI**. But in the ChirpStack’s implementation, only the Device EUI and the Application Key are mandatory. The Application EUI is not required and is not recorded in the Application tab. Nevertheless, the Application EUI is a mandatory parameter in the RAK7200 module’s firmware. To resolve this mismatch, you can reuse the Device EUI as the Application EUI during the configuration in the side of the node.

:::


###### Configure the OTAA mode on the RAK7200

The RAK7200 module supports a series of AT commands to configure its internal parameters and control the functionalities of the module.

To set up the RAK7200 module to join ChirpStack using OTAA start by connecting the RAK7200 module to the Computer (see **Figure 1**) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool, wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication by sending either of these two AT commands:


```
at+get_config=lora:status
```

```
at+version
```

As an example, these are the list of the parameters you need to configure in RAK7200:

- LoRa join mode: **OTAA**
- LoRa class: **Class A**
- LoRa region: **AU915**
- Device EUI: **744d4452dd39037c**
- Application EUI: **70B3D57ED001C544**
- Application Key: **4E2003296FC5CD26F46940A6DAFA9D1**

1. Set the LoRa join mode to OTAA.

```
at+set_config=lora:join_mode:0
```

/>

:::tip NOTE
Remember, the Application EUI parameter was not required in the ChirpStack platform. Therefore, it is possible to use the same ID as the Device EUI. Otherwise, the firmware will complain.
:::

6. Set the Application Key.

- Get the Application Key from the TTN register.


```
at+set_config=lora:app_key:4E2003296FC5CD26F46940A6DAFA9D1
```

<RkImage
  src="https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/52.app-key.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="Setting LoRa Application Key Parameter"
/>

:::tip NOTE
After configuring all parameters, you need to reset RAK7200 Module to save the parameters.
:::

7. After resetting, start to join.

```
at+join
```

After 5 or 6&nbsp;seconds, if the request was successfully received by a LoRa gateway, then you should see the messages shown in **Figure 51**.

<RkImage
  src="https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/53.otaa-join-chirpstack.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="Chirpstack OTAA Join the Network via RAK Serial Port Tool"
/>

8. You can then see the **JoinRequest** and **JoinAccept** on ChirpStack page.

  caption="Checking LoRaWAN Joint Request in Chirpstack OTAA Console"
/>

- On the ChirpStack platform, you should also see the messages in the LORAWAN FRAMES tab as shown in **Figure 52**.

:::tip NOTE

By convention, messages sent from nodes to gateways are considered as **Uplinks**. While messages sent by gateways to nodes are considered as **Downlinks**.

This concludes the exercise to send data in the OTAA mode.


##### ABP Mode

###### Configure the ABP Mode on the Platform

During the registration of a new device, if you select **DeviceProfile_ABP** or **DeviceProfile_ABP_CN470**, as shown in Figure 54, then the ChirpStack platform will assume that this device will join to the LoRaWAN network using the ABP mode.

:::tip NOTE

Check **Disable counting frame verification**. During the test, when the module is restarted, the frame counting number will be also be restarted from zero. This would cause a synchronization problem with the ChirpStack server treating it as a replay attack. For the testing purpose, it is safe to disable this feature, but remember to activate it in a production environment.

* The parameters can be generated as random numbers by the platform or can be set with user values. Once these parameters are filled properly, the process is completed by clicking on the **ACTIVATE DEVICE** button.


###### Configure the ABP mode on the RAK7200

In the following steps, you will configure the RAK7200 module to work in the ABP mode. To set up the RAK7200 module to join ChirpStack using ABP start by connecting the RAK7200 module to the Computer (see **Figure 1**) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool, wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication by sending either of these two AT commands:

```
at+get_config=lora:status
```

```
at+version
```

As an example, these are the list of the parameters you need to configure in RAK7200:

- LoRa join mode: **ABP**
- LoRa class: **Class A**
- LoRa region: **AU915**
- Device address: **019c820a**
- Network Session Key: **34fb174daa6dc34733495f73bd2b1ba1**
- Application Session Key: **d7fde8da53ded21216fe71d4f91ecf0e**

1. Set LoRa join mode to ABP.

:::tip NOTE

After configuring all parameters, you need to reset RAK7200 Module for saving parameters.

:::

7. After resetting RAK7200 Module, join in ABP mode.

```
at+join
```

:::tip NOTE

By using the ABP mode in LoRaWAN protocol, it doesn’t require to join a network before sending LoRaWAN package. But to keep the consistency of internal states of the firmware of the RAK7200 module, it still required to send at+join command in the ABP mode. This time, the firmware should reply almost immediately with an **OK**.

:::

Once the RAK7200 joined into a LoRaWAN network, it will start to send periodically the data collected from the GPS and other sensors. Then, go to the ChirpStack platform to confirm that the messages ware properly received as shown in **Figure 62**.

### Miscellaneous

#### Upgrading the Firmware

Before you start working with the RAK7200, it is recommended to keep the RAK7200 module updated to the latest version of the firmware. Download the latest [RAK7200 firmware](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisnode/rak7200/datasheet/#firmware).

In this section, you will upgrade the firmware by using the **STM32CubeProgrammer** provided by STM32. Execute the following steps in upgrading the firmware.

1. Install the [**STM32CubeProgrammer**](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-programmers/stm32cubeprog.html#overview) tool on your Windows PC.

2. Connect the RAK7200 module to the USB interface of a general-purpose computer as shown in **Figure 1**.

3. To program the firmware, the RAK7200 module must be entered into the boot mode. You can achieve it by following this procedure:
  - Hold down the BOOT0 button, and then press the Reset button.
  - Release the Reset button, then release the BOOT0 button.

  width="50%"
  caption="RAK7200 BOOT0 and Reset buttons"
/>

4. Open the **STM32CubeProgrammer** tool and select the UART as the type of connection to the RAK7200 module. Then, configure the following communication parameters:

  - Port: **choose the port assigned by the operative system**
  - Baud rate: **115200**.
  - Parity: **Even**

  width="90%"
  caption="STM32CubeProgrammer UART Communication Parameters"
/>

5. Once the connection parameters were properly set, press the **Connect** button located at the top right corner. If there were problems during the connection, the errors would be shown in Log message box. The usual problem is because the RAK7200 didn’t entered into the boot mode properly. In such cases, you will find similar error messages shown in **Figure 65**.

<RkImage
  src="https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/66.error-messages.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Error Messages Received when not in Boot Mode"
/>

6. After connecting successfully, the STM32CubeProgrammer will display **Data read successfully** in the log message box.

  src="https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/67.messages-received.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Messages Received when connected in Boot Mode"
/>

7. Once the communication is established with the RAK7200, burn a newer version of firmware into the RAK7200 module:

  - **Erase the existing data**: To avoid unexpected problems during the future usage of the module, it’s a good practice to erase completely the EEPROM before burning the new version of firmware. You can achieve it by clicking on the Erase button highlighted in red square in **Figure 67**.

<RkImage
  src="https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/68.erase-button.png"
