## Product Description

The **RAK2461 WisNode Bridge IO Lite** bridges different Digital Inputs, Outputs (Relay), and RS-485 communication to LoRaWAN® for industrial applications. The device relays data using the LoRaWAN network as a means of wirelessly transmitting to and from the end devices.

It is an ideal solution for seamless LoRaWAN communication within industrial environments. Engineered with industrial-grade reliability and based on the RAK3172-T LoRaWAN module, the RAK2461 ensures long-range connectivity, even in extreme temperatures from -20°&nbsp;C to +70°&nbsp;C.

This device can operate on all LoRaWAN bands within the standard parameters set by the LoRa Alliance. It offers versatile mounting options for easy installation in any environment, whether for industrial automation or smart city infrastructure. Together with a <a href="https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisgate/" target="_blank"> RAK Gateway </a>, building a wireless industrial system or extending an existing one can be easy and quick. Moreover, the RAK2461 offers unparalleled performance and durability.

The device comes in two variants:

## Typical Network Application

RAK2461 WisNode Bridge IO Lite provides different Digital Inputs, Outputs (Relay), and RS-485 communication. It can convert the data of the connected devices into LoRaWAN that can be sent to the cloud server via a standard gateway. Cloud server can also actively send data to RS-485 terminals and control the DI/DO data transmission, to achieve two-way data communication. Using RAK2461, what used to be a costly and time-consuming cable line network deployment can be transformed into a rapid and cost-efficient wireless network deployment.
