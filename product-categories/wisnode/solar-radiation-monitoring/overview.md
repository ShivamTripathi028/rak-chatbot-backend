## Solution Description

The Solar Radiation Solution combines the RAK Sensor Hub with the RK200-03 Solar Pyranometer Radiation Sensor, making it well-suited for monitoring solar activity in weather stations, solar installations, and agriculture. Equipped with a temperature compensation circuit, the sensor ensures accurate data by minimizing ambient temperature effects.

With the plug-and-play feature of the Sensor Hub, the Solar Radiation Sensor Solution comes with pre-installed components ready for easy installation and connection. The sensor provides highly accurate solar radiation readings, with the Sensor Hub collecting and transmitting the data via LoRaWAN or NB-IoT/CAT M1.

The Sensor Hub’s connectivity function allows for versatile data transmission to the cloud using the two most commonly used communication protocols in IoT. This versatility ensures that data is readily available for storage, visualization, and in-depth analysis, enabling informed decision-making based on comprehensive knowledge of solar radiation levels.
