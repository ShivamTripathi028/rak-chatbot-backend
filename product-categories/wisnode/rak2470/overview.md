## Product Description

The **RAK2470 WisNode Bridge Serial Prime** is an RS485 to LoRaWAN converter designed for outdoor industrial applications. Utilizing the LoRaWAN network, RAK2470 wirelessly transmits RS485 data to and from end devices. 

Additionally, RAK2470 WisNode Bridge Serial Prime comes with a T-type conversion cable, enabling it to link up with any RS485 equipped sensors. Both the RAK2470 and connected sensors can be powered via the DC power port. 

RAK2470's default interface, the M12-4 circular connector, permits direct connection to MPPT Solar Charge Controllers, Inverters, or Inverter Integrated Machines. 

Together with a RAK WisGate Gateway and LoRa Server products, RAK2470 can quickly and easily build a wireless industrial field control system. It is designed with industrial-grade protection, accommodates a wide range of voltage supplies, supports pole mounting, and facilitates field installation and use.

## Product Features

- **Regional Parameters Version**: RP001-1.0.3
- **LoRaWAN 1.0.3** protocol stack, supports **Class C**
- **Input range:** 5 ~ 12 V<sub>DC</sub>
- **Mounting:** Pole
- IP67 weatherproof

## Typical Network Application

RAK2470 WisNode Serial Prime converts data from the RS485 protocol into LPWAN wireless messages and delivers it to a cloud server through an LPWAN gateway. Using the RAK2470, you can connect up to 32 RS485 sensors and convert data from a conventional RS485 wired network to a wireless network. Using RAK2470, what used to be a costly and time-consuming cable line network deployment can be transformed into a rapid and cost-efficient wireless network deployment.
