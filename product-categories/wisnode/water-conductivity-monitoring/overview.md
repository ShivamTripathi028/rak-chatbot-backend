### Solution Description

The Water Conductivity Sensor Solution is an ideal tool for monitoring water conductivity, comprising the RAK Sensor Hub and the JXBS-3001-TDS sensor. This comprehensive monitoring system is suitable for use in various settings, such as thermal power, chemical fertilizers, and biochemical industries.

With the plug-and-play feature of the Sensor Hub, the Water Conductivity Solution includes  pre-installed components ready for easy installation and connection. The sensor provides highly accurate water conductivity readings, while the Sensor Hub collects and transmits the data via LoRaWAN or NB-IoT/CAT M1.

The Sensor Hub’s connectivity function allows for versatile data transmission to the cloud using the two most commonly used communication protocols in IoT. This versatility ensures that data is readily available for storage, visualization, and in-depth analysis, enabling informed decision-making based on comprehensive knowledge of water conductivity.
