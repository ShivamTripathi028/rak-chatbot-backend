### Solution Description

The Environmental and Barometric Monitoring Solution integrates the RAK1901 temperature and humidity sensor and RAK1902 barometric pressure sensor. This solution features low power consumption and accurate data acquisition capabilities. It has critical requirements for temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure, ideal for the food industry, agricultural, and industrial applications.

With the plug-and-play feature of the Sensor Hub, the Environmental and Barometric Monitoring Solution comes with pre-installed components ready for easy installation and connection. The sensor provides highly accurate soil pH readings, with the Sensor Hub collecting and transmitting the data via LoRaWAN or NB-IoT/CAT M1.

The Sensor Hub’s connectivity function allows for versatile data transmission to the cloud using the two most commonly used communication protocols in IoT. This versatility ensures that data is readily available for storage, visualization, and in-depth analysis, enabling informed decision-making based on comprehensive knowledge of temperature, humidity and barometric pressure levels.
