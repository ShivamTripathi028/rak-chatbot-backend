### Solution Description

The Sensor Hub Barometric Pressure Monitoring solution is a version of the Sensor Hub that includes the popular RAK1902 barometric pressure sensor in the [Sensor Probe.](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/atmosphere-monitoring?m=3&h=sensorhub-solution&variant=42510932508870) This solution can be used in scenarios with critical requirements for barometric pressure, such as meteorology, aviation, marine navigation, engineering, and construction, among others.

With the plug-and-play feature of the Sensor Hub, the Barometric Pressure Solution comes with pre-installed components ready for easy installation and connection. The sensor provides highly accurate barometric pressure readings, with the Sensor Hub collecting and transmitting the data via LoRaWAN or NB-IoT/CAT M1.

The Sensor Hub’s connectivity function allows for versatile data transmission to the cloud using the two most commonly used communication protocols in IoT. This versatility ensures that data is readily available for storage, visualization, and in-depth analysis, enabling informed decision-making based on comprehensive knowledge of barometric pressure levels.
