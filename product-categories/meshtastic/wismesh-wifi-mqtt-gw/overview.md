# Meshtastic WisMesh WiFi MQTT Gateway

Thank you for choosing **WisMesh WiFi MQTT Gateway** in your awesome IoT Project! 🎉 To help you get started, we have provided you with all the necessary documentation for your product.

[Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) is an Open Source initiative aimed at building an off-grid, decentralized mesh network. Designed to operate on affordable, low-power devices.

This network is especially vital in scenarios where traditional communication systems fail, such as during disasters. Empowering individuals and groups within the HAM radio community and beyond, Meshtastic ensures connectivity when it's needed most.

The **WisMesh WiFi MQTT Gateway** connects your Meshtastic devices to the cloud, enabling communication with either the official Meshtastic MQTT broker or your own MQTT broker. It supports sending sensor data, location information, and text messages.

:::tip NOTE
The **WisMesh WiFi MQTT Gateway** was updated to **WisMesh WiFi MQTT Gateway V2** by replacing the ESP32-WROVER MCU with an ESP32-S3 MCU. This update does not affect the device's functionality.
:::

The original device featured the WisBlock RAK11200 Core module with Meshtastic firmware, integrated WiFi and BLE, and the RAK13300 LoRa module, all mounted on the RAK19007 Base Board.

With the update to **WisMesh WiFi MQTT Gateway V2**, the device now uses the WisBlock RAK3312 Core module with Meshtastic firmware, and features integrated WiFi, BLE, and a LoRa transceiver.
