5. The kit includes pre-drilled holes for antennas, which are useful if you are using additional HATs such as the [RAK5146 HAT](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wishat/rak2287-rak5146-pi-hat/overview/) for LoRaWAN or the [RAK2013 HAT](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wislink/rak2013/overview/) for cellular connectivity. If these holes are not needed, you can cover them with the provided rubber caps. Additionally, unused ports on the side of the enclosure can be concealed using the provided sticker.
