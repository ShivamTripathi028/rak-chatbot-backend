## Product Background

**Hotspot Details**

- Efficient for mining Helium (HNT) cryptocurrency
- Complete set-up in minutes using a smartphone
- **LongFi technology** maximizes range and battery life without Wi-Fi, cellular or Bluetooth
- Low Power – only uses about the same amount as an LED light bulb (5 W)
- Easily manage Hotspots and tokens from the mobile app
- LongFi™ Technology

![longfi](https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/wisgate/rak-hotspot/icons/longfi.png)

**Helium LongFi** is a technology architecture that combines leading wireless technology, LoRaWAN, and the Helium Blockchain. LongFi is optimized for miles of range, and long battery life for IoT devices.

![proof-of-coverage](https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/wisgate/rak-hotspot/icons/proof-of-coverage.png)

RAK Hotspots earn Helium when devices connect and for validating wireless coverage provided by peers. Through a system called Proof-of-Coverage, RAK Hotspots earn more Helium when they are within range of other RAK Hotspots, provided they are at least 300 meters apart.

The range depends on the environment: in rural areas, it can reach **up to 10 miles or more**, while in dense urban areas, it is typically **up to a mile**. A single RAK Hotspot earns less because it can only issue Challenges over the internet and cannot participate in Proof-of-Coverage.

![wireless-coverage](https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/wisgate/rak-hotspot/icons/wireless-coverage.png)

- Provide coverage across many square miles with a single RAK Hotspot.
- Based on initial testing, only about 50 to 100 RAK Hotspots are needed to provide complete
coverage for an entire city.

- Create a new global network for billions of devices
- Any IoT device can be made Helium-enabled using readily available off-the-shelf hardware components, software, and an open-source reference design that anyone can enhance.
