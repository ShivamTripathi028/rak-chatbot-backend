# RAK7391 WisGate Connect Assembly Guide

## Indoor Rack Enclosure

1. Install the CM4 module. The module does not need to be fixed with screws but it is recommended.

4. Pass the RF cable/connector through the circular openings in the shell and secure it using the washer and nut. Ensure the pigtails are sufficiently long and that the connector polarity matches your antenna's polarity (SMA or RP-SMA). If these connectors are not needed for your setup, use the provided rubber plugs to seal the openings.

### Connect the PoE Adapter

1. Connect the Ethernet cable from the enclosure to the Ethernet port labeled PoE on the adapter.
2. Connect an Ethernet cable from your LAN network to the Ethernet port labeled LAN on the adapter.
3. Connect one end of the power cord to the adapter. Connect the other end of the power cord to a power outlet.

### Weather Protection

To better protect the Ethernet cable gland and the antenna connector from the weather, you need to cover them with PVC tape.

1. Clean the surface of the connector to be wrapped. Wrap a layer of PVC tape with a 50% overlap, following the connector's rotation direction. Extend the wrapping approximately 10&nbsp;mm below the end of the connector.

2. Cut a 50&nbsp;cm length of waterproof tape and stretch it to double its length. Wrap three layers around the connector with a 50% overlap. Hold the tape firmly in place with your hand for a few seconds to secure it.
