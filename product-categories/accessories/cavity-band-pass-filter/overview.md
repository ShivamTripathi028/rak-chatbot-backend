## Product Description

The **RAK Outdoor Cavity Band-Pass Filter** is an RF accessory designed to enhance LoRaWAN gateway performance in environments with high interference. It allows only the target LoRa frequency band to pass while attenuating out-of-band signals such as LTE, 5G, radar, and industrial noise.

The filter is based on a high-Q resonant cavity design, isolating the target frequency band and reducing the impact of external interference. This ensures stable and reliable gateway performance in urban and industrial deployments where RF noise is significant.

## Product Features

- **High out-of-band rejection**: >75&nbsp;dB attenuation to suppress LTE, 5G, radar, and other signals.
- **Low insertion loss**: 2.0–3.2&nbsp;dB (model dependent), preserving LoRa signal strength.
- **Easy integration**: Standard N-Female connectors, no adapters required.
- **Available frequency variants**: EU868, US915, IN865, RU864, AU915, KR920, AS923-1/2/3/4, CN470.
