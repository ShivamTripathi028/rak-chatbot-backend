## Product Description

The UPS PoE-03 is a specialized Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) device designed for Power over Ethernet (PoE) applications, providing backup power and protection to PoE-powered devices. It includes features like surge protection, voltage regulation, and intelligent battery management. It also detects intelligent adapter power capability and controls overcurrent buck.

When the output current exceeds the rated current, the output voltage drops and the output power is adjusted; when the output current exceeds 5% of the rated current, the overcurrent protection is triggered.

This product powers the RAK7268 Indoor Gateway and RAK7289 Outdoor Gateway without the need for a main power supply.
