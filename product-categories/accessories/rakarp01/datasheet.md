# 860-930MHz 12dBi Directional Antenna Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

RAKARP01 is a high-gain directional antenna is the latest in the RAKwireless LPWAN accessories portfolio. It is specifically useful in scenarios where directional signal reception is necessary, allowing for precise pointing to the field of your main signals, reducing the SNR. The high gain allows for a better reception from high-distance devices. Easy to mount with the included mounting kit.

1. Determine the placement of the antenna, take it and the accessories out of the package, and prepare your tools (a wrench).

2. Install the antenna to a ∅ 30 ~ 75 mm mounting pole using the clamps, screw bolts, and saw-tooth clamps as shown in Figure 3.

3. Position the antenna and the pole in parallel, adjust the height, then fully tighten the upper and lower clamps' nuts.

4. Adjust the tilt of the antenna, then tighten the nuts of the screw bolts indicated by ★.

5. Connect the feeder cable to the antenna connector and wrap the waterproof tape. After that, the installation finished.

:::tip NOTE
The positioning and height of the antenna should be pursuant to the installation environment. Make sure that there are no tall buildings or large bodies of metal nearby, there should be no obstructions around it.
