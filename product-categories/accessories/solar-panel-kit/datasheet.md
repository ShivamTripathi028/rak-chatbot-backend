# Solar Panel Kit for Battery Plus Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

This 80&nbsp;W solar panel is specially selected to meet the needs of the Battery Plus system making it the perfect accessory for your green solutions or ones in remote areas. It is based on monocrystalline solar cells and has an expected life of more than 25 years. With the included mounting kit, you can build and power an off-grid deployment scenario. Using the **WisGate Edge Pro** gateway in a combination with the **Battery Plus** and the **Solar Panel**, you are getting reliable network coverage without power loss.

### Features
