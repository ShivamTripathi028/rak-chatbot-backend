# UPS 12V1A-V01 Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The UPS 12V1A-V01 is a compact Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) device designed to provide backup power and protection for small electronic devices. It is commonly used to safeguard sensitive equipment against power outages and voltage fluctuations.

It has safe and environmental friendly lithium-ion cells, a credible and stable PCB, and a trickle/constant-current/constant-voltage lithium battery charging battery management system (BMS) created by a high-performance and efficient DC-DC, boosting, and switching circuit.

Additionally, it has useful features such as over-charged, over-discharged, over-current, and short-circuit protection. This product can power the RAK7268 Gateway device without requiring a main power supply.
