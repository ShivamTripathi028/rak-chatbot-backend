## Storage Conditions

When the UPS12V1A-V01 is stored, the self-discharge rate is affected by the ambient temperature. Remove it from the RAK7268 and fully charge it if it will not be used for a long time. Then turn it off and store it in a cool, dry place.
The UPS12V1A-V01 should not be stored without charging for more than the time indicated below:

- Storage for 1 month: -20° C ~ 60° C
- Storage for 3 months: -20° C ~ 45° C
- Storage for 6 months: -20° C ~ 25° C

In addition, charge it regularly (once every 3 ~ 5 months) to prevent excessive discharge. An excessive discharge will affect the battery’s performance and function. The charging time is approximately 4 ~ 5 hours, and the voltage is maintained between 11.1 V ~ 12.6 V.
