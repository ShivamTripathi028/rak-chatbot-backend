# 902-928 MHz 5 dBi Fiberglass Antenna Datasheet

## Overview

The 5&nbsp;dBi Fiberglass antenna is an outdoor, high-performance antenna, designed to withstand harsh outdoor conditions. It is specially designed for LoRa in the 902-928&nbsp;MHz band – US915, AU915, AS923, and KR920.
The antenna connector is one with the antenna body - this design further increases the resistance of the antenna to external conditions.
With a length of only 480&nbsp;mm, this antenna will be the best fit for your LPWAN gateway or outdoor deployed RAK Hotspot.

:::tip NOTE
This antenna is designed to be directly mounted on the enclosure of the Gateway. It is suitable for the following RAK products:
