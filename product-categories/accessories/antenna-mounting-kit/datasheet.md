# Antenna Mounting Kit Datasheet

To achieve better coverage, outdoor antennas need to be installed in an elevated area with good visibility. Generally, the antenna is installed on a pole, but in the dense city environment, a pole is not easy to find and fix. With that, RAK presents four different antenna mounting options that help you to easily mount your antenna in almost every scenario.

## Variants

### L-Shaped Wall Mounting Pole

**Application Scenarios**: Fixed on the vertical facade, such as the sidewall of the building or roof parapet.

### Small U-Shaped Hoisting Pole

**Application Scenarios**: Fixed in roof and window eaves, indoor ceiling keel.

### Large U-Shaped Hoisting Pole

**Application Scenarios**: Fixed on the roof and window eaves. Compared to the previous one, it takes up more space, but the antenna installation position is relatively separated from the eaves so that the antenna can extend out of the roof, and the signal effect will be better.

## Quick Assembly Guide

1. Fix the antenna between the flat bracket plate and the U-shaped bracket plate, using M4 Screws.

2. Fix the appropriate pole on the wall or other position of the building. 

:::tip NOTE

The included screws in the kit for this purpose are standard. Depending on the surface material, altitude, wind speed, and other variables, the screws might need to be changed with more suitable ones.

3. Fix the antenna onto the pole with the U-shaped brackets and nuts as shown in Figure 10.
