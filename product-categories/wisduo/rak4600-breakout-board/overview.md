## Product Description

The **RAK4600 Breakout Board** is specifically designed to provide easy access to the board's pins, simplifying development and testing. The breakout board's form factor converts the RAK4600 stamp module pinout to 2.54 mm headers.

The board itself has the RAK4600 at its core, integrating an **nRF52832 MCU** and an **SX1276 LoRa chip**. It has an ultra-low power consumption of 13.3 μA (down to 11.2 μA @ 2.0 V) in sleep mode, and high LoRa output power (20 dBm) in work mode. Its BLE output power is up to 4 dBm.

The board complies with **LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specification**. It also supports LoRa Point-to-Point (P2P) communication.

The RF communication capabilities of the board (LoRa + BLE) make it ideal for various IoT applications. These include home and building automation, sensor networks, and personal area networks for health and fitness monitoring.
