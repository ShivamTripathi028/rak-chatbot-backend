## Product Description

The RAK811 Breakout Board is a compact, low-power device that leverages long-range LoRa technology and wireless transceiver capabilities. It combines the RAK811 chipset and the Semtech SX1276 at its core, utilizing the full range of LoRa features.

The RAK811 Breakout Board complies with the latest LoRaWAN Class A and C protocol specifications, featuring full support for the LoRaWAN 1.0.2 stack in its firmware. It offers a simple and straightforward setup, enabling quick access to LWPA IoT platforms. Additionally, it supports LoRa Point-to-Point (P2P) communication, allowing customers to implement their own private LoRa networks.

The node can work in a number of modes, with different data rates and read data from the attached sensors with the help of its serial AT commands.

This board is a complete solution in developing your LoRaWAN protocol techniques. A few of its application includes: Automated Meters Reading, Home and Building Automation, Wireless Alarm and Security Systems, Industrial Monitoring and Control and Long Range Irrigation Systems
