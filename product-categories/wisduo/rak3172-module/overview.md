## Product Description

The RAK3172 is a low-power, long-range transceiver module based on the STM32WLE5CC chip. It provides an easy-to-use, small-sized, low-power solution for long-range wireless data applications. This module complies with Classes A, B, and C of the LoRaWAN 1.0.3 specifications. It can easily connect to different LoRaWAN server platforms like The Things Network (TTN), Chirpstack, Actility, etc. It also supports LoRa Point-to-Point (P2P) communication mode, which helps you implement your own customized long-range LoRa network quickly.

You can configure the module's mode and operation using AT commands via a UART interface. The RAK3172 also offers low-power features that are well-suited for battery-powered applications.
