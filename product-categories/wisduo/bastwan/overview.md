## Product Description

The **RAK3244 BastWAN Breakout Board** is designed to be compatible with the **Feather format** while leveraging the capabilities of the RAK4260 module. At its core, the board features the RAK4260, a module built around the ATSAMR34J18B SiP. This high level of integration delivers exceptional performance, including LoRa TX power of up to 20 dBm.

A key feature of this breakout board is the ATECC606A **cryptographic co-processor**, which provides secure, hardware-based key storage. This sets the RAK3244 BastWAN apart from the RAK4200 and RAK4600 by adding an extra layer of security to future-proof your platform.

The board complies with LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specification, and it also supports LoRa P2P Point-to-Point communication. The low power, long-range LoRa communication capabilities of the board make it suitable for a variety of applications in the IoT field such as home automation, sensor networks, building automation, and personal area networks applications such as health/fitness sensors and monitors.
