## Product Description

The **RAK11721 Breakout Board** is specifically designed to allow easy access to the pins on the board to simplify development and testing. The breakout board footprint allows the RAK11720 stamp module pins to be accessible via the 2.54&nbsp;mm headers.

The board itself has the RAK11720 at its core, integrating an **Ambiq Apollo3 Blue AMA3B1KK-KBR-B0 SoC MCU** chip and **Semtech SX1262** LoRa transceiver. It has an ultra-low power consumption of 2.37&nbsp;uA in sleep mode.

This module complies with Class A, B, and C of LoRaWAN 1.0.3 specifications. It also supports LoRa Point-to-Point (P2P) communication mode, which helps you in implementing your own customized LoRa network quickly.
