# RAK11720 WisDuo LPWAN+BLE Module AT Command Manual

## Overview

The RAK11720 is based on the Ambiq Apollo3 Blue AMA3B1KK-KBR-B0 SoC MCU and Semtech LoRa transceiver SX1262.  It is designed to simplify LoRaWAN and LoRa point-to-point (P2P) communication. It also features the Apollo3 Blue chip's BLE functionality. To integrate LoRa technology into your projects, the RAK11720 uses an easy-to-use serial port communication interface for sending AT commands.  Through these AT commands, you can set the parameters needed for LoRa P2P and LoRaWAN communication.
