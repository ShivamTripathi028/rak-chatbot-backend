## Product Description

RAK811 Low-Power Long-Range LoRa Technology Transceiver module provides an easy-to-use, small size, and low-power solution for long-range wireless data applications.

This module complies with Class A & C of LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specifications. It can easily connect to different LoRaWAN server platforms like TheThingsNetwork (TTN), Chirpstack, Actility, etc. It also supports LoRa Point-to-Point (P2P) communication mode which helps you in implementing your own customized long-range LoRa network quickly.

The RAK811 module is integrated with Semtech’s SX1276 and STM32. You can configure the mode and operation of the module using AT commands via a UART interface. RAK811 also offers low-power features, which are very suitable for battery-powered applications.
