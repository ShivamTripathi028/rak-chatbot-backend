## Product Description

The **RAK4260 Breakout Board** is designed to provide easy access to the board's pins, simplifying development and testing. Its breakout board form factor transfers the RAK4260 stamp module pinout to 2.54 mm headers, making debugging more convenient for developers.

The board itself has the RAK4260 at its core, which is a module that utilizes the **ATSAMR34J18B SIP**. This high level of integration allows for outstanding performance: 860 nA in sleep mode and LoRa TX Power of up to 20 dBm.

A key feature of this Breakout Board is the **ATECC608A Cryptographic Co-Processor**, which provides secure hardware-based key storage. This sets the board apart from the RAK4200 and RAK4600, adding an extra layer of security to future-proof your platform.

The board complies with LoRaWAN 1.0.2 protocols. It also supports LoRa Point-to-Point (P2P)communication.

The board's low-power, long-range LoRa communication capabilities make it ideal for various IoT applications, including home automation, sensor networks, building automation, and personal area networks such as health and fitness sensors and monitors.
