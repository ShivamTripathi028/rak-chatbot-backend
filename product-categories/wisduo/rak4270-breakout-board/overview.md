## Product Description

The **RAK4270 Breakout Board** is a compact board specifically designed to simplify external connections to the RAK4270 pins. Its primary purpose is to provide access to the stamp module's pins via two rows of 2.54 mm headers, making it convenient for debugging.

The RAK4270 LoRa Module includes an **STM32L071 MCU** and an **SX1262 LoRa chip**, which supports eight (8) spreading factors (**SF5 ~ SF12**) and signal bandwidth that can be adjusted between **7.8 kHz** to **500 kHz**. It has Ultra-Low Power Consumption of 2.31 μA (down to 1.61 μA @ 2.0 V) in sleep mode, but during the Transmit mode, it can reach the maximum output power of **22 dBm**. As a receiver, it can achieve a sensitivity of **-148 dBm**.

The module complies with the LoRaWAN 1.0.2 protocol, so it can be used for implementing LoRa networks or Lora point-to-point communications. The module is suitable for various applications that require long-range data acquisition and low power consumption, like smart meters, supply chain and logistics tracking, agricultural sensors, smart cities, etc.

This module is expected to be controlled by an external controller through its UART interface by sending a set of AT commands. These AT commands control not only the state of this module but also set the LoRaWan communication parameters and payloads (see RAK [AT Command Manualt](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisduo/rak4270-breakout-board/at-command-manual/)).
