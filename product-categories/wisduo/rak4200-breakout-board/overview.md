## Product Description

The **RAK4200 Breakout Board** is specifically designed to allow easy access to the pins on the board to simplify development and testing. The breakout board footprint allows the RAK4200 stamp module pins to be transferred to 2.54&nbsp;mm headers.

The board itself has the RAK4200 at its core, integrating an **STM32L071KB MCU** and an **SX1276 LoRa transceiver**. It has an ultra-low power consumption of 9.40&nbsp;uA (down to 1.08&nbsp;uA @ 2.0&nbsp;V) in sleep mode, and high LoRa output power (19&nbsp;dBm) in work mode.

The board complies with LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specification. It also supports LoRa Point-to-Point (P2P) communication.

The board's low-power, long-range LoRa communication capabilities make it ideal for various IoT applications, including home automation, sensor networks, building automation, and personal area networks, such as health and fitness sensors and monitors.
