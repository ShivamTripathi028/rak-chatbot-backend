# RAK11160 WisDuo LoRaWAN + BLE + WiFi Module AT Command Manual

## Overview

The RAK11160 is based on the STM32WLE5 MCU and Espressif ESP8684 co-processor. It is designed to simplify LoRaWAN and LoRa point-to-point (P2P) communication. To integrate LoRa technology into your projects, the RAK11160 uses an easy-to-use serial port communication interface for sending AT commands. Through these AT commands, set the parameters needed for LoRa P2P and LoRaWAN communication of the STM32WLE5. Through the same UART, the ESP8684's Espressif AT commands for WiFi and BLE can be setup.

## RUI3 AT Command List

The RAK11160 default firmware is based on [RUI3 RAKwireless Unified Interface V3](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/software-apis-and-libraries/rui3/overview/). Access the AT command via UART2 by default.

The complete list of commands can be found in [RUI3 AT Commands Documentation](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/software-apis-and-libraries/rui3/at-command-manual/).

The Espressif AT command manual can be found on Espressif's website in [ESP-AT User Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-at/en/latest/esp32/AT_Command_Set/index.html).
