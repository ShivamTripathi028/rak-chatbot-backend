## Product Description

The RAK3272-SiP and RAK3272LP-SiP Breakout Boards were designed to allow easy access to the <a href="https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisduo/rak3172-sip/overview/" target="_blank">RAK3172-SiP/RAK3172LP-SiP</a> module pins to simplify development and testing. The two SiP module variants use different RF output paths to optimize current consumption depending on the application. RAK3172-SiP uses RFO_HP while RAK3172LP-SiP uses the RFO_LP on the STM32WL SoC transceiver.

The microcontroller's GPIO pins are accessible through 2.54 mm headers. The breakout board is powered by either the RAK3172-SiP or the RAK3172LP-SiP, both of which are based on the STM32WLE5JC. The STM32WLE5JC belongs to the <a href="https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32wlex.html" target="_blank">STM32WLE5x</a> family. It features an Arm® Cortex®-M4 core operating at 48 MHz and includes a sub-GHz radio based on the Semtech SX126x.

The board complies with Class A, B, & C of LoRaWAN 1.0.3 specifications and also features LoRa Point-to-Point (P2P) communication mode, which helps you in implementing your own customized long-range LoRa network quickly. It is also RUI3 compatible which allows you to create custom firmware using RUI3 APIs.
