## Product Description

The **RAK5146** is an LPWAN Concentrator Module in a mini-PCIe form factor, featuring the Semtech SX1303 and SX126X for the Listen Before Talk (LBT) feature, enabling seamless integration into existing routers or other network equipment with LPWAN Gateway capabilities.

This concentrator can be used with any embedded platform that has an available mini-PCIe slot with SPI/USB connectivity. Additionally, it includes an onboard **ZOE-M8Q GPS** chip.

This module offers an exceptional, comprehensive, and cost-efficient gateway solution. It provides up to 10 programmable parallel demodulation paths, an 8 x 8 channel LoRa packet detector, 8 x SF5-SF12 LoRa demodulators, and 8 x SF5-SF10 LoRa demodulators.

Additionally, RAK5146 can detect an uninterrupted combination of packets at 8 different spreading factors and 10 channels. It can continuously demodulate up to 16 packets, making it suitable for smart metering fixed networks and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications.
