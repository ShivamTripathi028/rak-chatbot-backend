# RAK2247 WisLink LPWAN Concentrator Datasheet

## Overview
### Description

:::tip NOTE
To address the chip shortage and not disrupt the operations of the customers and partners, the RAK2247 SPI is available with SX1308 core. It can completely replace the RAK2247 with SX1301. The only difference is the operating temperature. For more information, check the [RAK2247 Operating Conditions](#operating-conditions).
:::

The **RAK2247 WisLink LPWAN Concentrator** is a LoRa Concentrator module with mini-PCIe form factor based on the SX1301. This enables easy integration into routers and other networking equipment, adding gateway capabilities. The module can be used in any embedded platform offering a mini-PCIe slot with an SPI or USB connection.

Despite its small size, this is an 8 channel concentrator module. By integrating it together with a computing core a fully fledged gateway solution can easily be created.

### Features

- Mini PCIe form factor, mounted heat-sink
- SX1301 base band processor emulates 49 x LoRa demodulators, 10 parallel demodulation paths. It supports 8 uplinks channels and 1 downlink channel
- 2 x SX125x Tx/Rx front-ends high/low frequency
- Built-in FT2232H for SPI to USB 2.0 conversion (optional)
- Operates at 3.3 V, making it compatible with standard 3G/LTE card slots of Mini PCI-e type
- Tx power up to 27 dBm, Rx sensitivity down to -139 dBm @ SF12, BW 125 kHz
- Supports global license-free frequency band (EU433, CN470, IN865, EU868, US915, AU915, KR920,  and AS923)

## Specifications

### Overview

The overview shows the top and back views of the RAK2247 board. It also presents the block diagram that discusses how the board works.

#### Board Overview

The outer dimension of the RAK2247 WisLink LPWAN Concentrator is **50.95 x 30.0 x 10.4 mm**. The board with top-side and bottom-side keep-out areas, and all other dimensions are defined by PCI Express Mini Card Electromechanical Specification except for the card thickness. The 10.4 mm thickness includes the 8 mm heat sink.

#### Block Diagram

RAK2247 WisLink LPWAN Concentrator integrates one SX1301 chip and two SX1255/7. The other chip is for RF signal, which represents the core of the device. This provides the related LoRa modem and processing functionalities. Additional signal conditioning circuitry is implemented for PCI Express Mini Card compliance, and one uFL connector is available for external antennas integration.

### Hardware

The hardware is categorized into six (6) parts. It discusses the interfacing, pinouts and its corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the parameters and standard values of the board.

:::tip NOTE
Detailed electrical and RF testing results can be found on [RAK2247 Hardware Test Report](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/LoRa/RAK2247-Mini-PCIe/Test-Report/RAK2247_VA_Test_Report_EU868.docx).

#### Interface

##### Power Supply

RAK2247 WisLink LPWAN Concentrator must be supplied through the **3.3 Vaux** pins by a **DC power supply**. The voltage must be stable, because during this operation the current drawn from 3.3 Vaux can vary significantly, based on the power consumption profile of the SX1301 chip (see [**SX1301 DS**](https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-core/sx1301#documentation) datasheet).

##### SPI Interface

SPI interface is provided on the PCIe_SCK, PCIe_MISO, PCIe_MOSI, PCIe_CSN pins of the system connector. The SPI interface gives access to the configuration register of SX1301 via a synchronous full-duplex protocol. Only the slave side is implemented.

:::tip NOTE
RAK2247-USB version does not have this interface.
:::

##### USB Interface

RAK2247 WisLink LPWAN Concentrator can support the high speed USB to SPI by FT2232HL, it includes a USB 2.0 compliant interface with a maximum 480 Mbps data rate, representing the interface for any communication with an external host application processor. The module itself acts as a USB device and can be connected to any USB host equipped with compatible drivers. For more information, refer to the [datasheet](https://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/ICs/DS_FT2232H.pdf) of FT2232HL.

:::tip NOTE
RAK2247-SPI version does not have this interface.

##### GPS_PPS

RAK2247 WisLink LPWAN Concentrator includes the GPS_PPS input for received packets time-stamped.

##### RESET

RAK2247 WisLink LPWAN Concentrator includes the RESET active-high input signal to reset the radio operations as specified by the SX1301 Specification.

##### LEDs

Three (3) Green LED for indicating the status of **PWR**, **TX**, **RX**.

##### Antenna RF Interface

The modules have one RF interface over a standard uFL connector (Hirose U. FL-RSMT) with a characteristic impedance of **50 Ω**. The RF port (J1) supports both Tx and Rx, providing the antenna interface.

#### Electrical Requirements

Exceeding the device's rating on one or more listed in the Absolute Maximum Rating section may cause permanent damage. These are stress ratings only.
Operating the module at these or at any conditions other than those specified in the Operating Conditions sections of the specification should be avoided. Exposure to Absolute Maximum Rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.
The operating condition range defines those limits within which the functionality of the device is guaranteed. Where application information is given, it is advisory only and does not form part of the specification.
