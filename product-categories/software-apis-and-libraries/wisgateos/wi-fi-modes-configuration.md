# WisGate OS Wi-Fi Modes Configuration

As mentioned in the Overview, the gateway can be configured to work in three modes: 

1. [**Access point**:](#access-point) You can connect to the gateway via the assigned IP.
2. [**Client**:](#client)  You can easily connect their gateway to a Wireless Network. AP won’t be available.
3. [**Access Point + Client**:](#access-point--client) Both modes will be available.

 

## Access Point

By default, the WisGate Edge Series work in Access Point (AP) mode.

In the **ESSID** field, the name of the AP is shown. The default name is **RAKXXXX_YYYY**, where **XXXX** is the model of the gateway (e.g. 7249), and **YYYY** are the last symbols of the MAC address of the gateway. The user can change that name to his desire. 

To protect their AP, you can choose between three encryption types. In the drop-down menu in the **Encryption** field, you can choose any of the following options: **WPA-PSK**, **WPA-PSK2**, and **WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK Mixed Mode**.

:::tip NOTE
**WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK Mixed Mode** is the recommended type of encryption. 
:::

When the desired protection is chosen, a **Key** field will pop up. In the **Key** field, enter a password to protect the AP. The green arrows ![13.a](https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/software-apis-and-library/wisgateos/subdocument1/13.a.png) on the right will show/hide the password.

Optionally, you can hide the AP by enabling the **Hidden** option. To connect to a hidden AP, you must manually type the ESSID, choose the correct encryption type, and type the password. 


## Client

In the **ESSID** field, you can type the name of their wireless network manually or click on the **Scan** button ![13.b](https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/software-apis-and-library/wisgateos/subdocument1/13.b.png) and scan the available networks.

In the **Encryption** field, you must choose what encryption is used by the network. After the correct one is selected, a **Key** field will pop up.

In the **Key** field, you must type the password that protects the wireless network. The green arrows ![13.a](https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/software-apis-and-library/wisgateos/subdocument1/13.a.png) right to the field will show/hide the password.

Below the **Wireless Client** menu, you can see the **Status** of the mode and select what protocol to use. You can choose between **Static address** or **DHCP client**. 

In the **DHCP mode**, there is not much to configure. The DHCP server of the router will set an IP for the gateway. You can enable/disable the **Use DNS servers advertised by peer** button. If the button is unchecked, the advertised DNS server addresses are going to be ignored. Optionally, you can override the MTU.

  caption="DHCP Client Protocol"
/>

If you chooses the Static address protocol, it can set a static IP address for the gateway. This way, after a reboot or restart of the router, the gateway will keep the assigned IP address.

To do so, you must type the IP of the network in the **IPv4 address** field (or the **IPv6 address** one if that version is used). In the **IPv4 netmask** field (or in **IPv6 routed prefix**), you must type the subnet mask (prefix for IPv6) of the IP address. For example the netmask for 192.168.0.128 is 255.255.255.0. 

In the **IPv4 gateway** (or **IPv6 gateway**) field, you must type the IP that will be assigned to the gateway.

Additionally, you can use custom DNS servers via the **Use custom DNS servers** field. You can add more than one server with the list button ![13.c](https://images.docs.rakwireless.com/software-apis-and-library/wisgateos/subdocument1/13.c.png).

In the **Override MTU** field,  you can set a size for the largest packet or frame that can be sent over the network. The MTU of an Ethernet connection is 1500 bytes.

## Access Point + Client

If this mode is selected, both the Access Point and Client mode will be available. You can connect the gateway to a wireless network and access it via the assigned IP.

The steps to configure the mode are the same as the explained above for the **Access Point** (for configuring AP) and **Client** (for configuring Client mode).
