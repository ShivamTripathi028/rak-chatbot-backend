# RAK3372 WisBlock LPWAN Module AT Command Manual

## Overview

The RAK3372 simplifies integrating LoRa technology into your projects by providing an easy-to-use Serial Port communication interface for sending AT commands. These commands allow you to configure the parameters required for LoRa P2P and LoRaWAN communication.

## RUI3 AT Command List

The RAK3372 default firmware is based on [RUI3 (RAKwireless Unified Interface V3)](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/software-apis-and-libraries/rui3/overview/). You can access the AT command via UART2 by default (and also possible via UART1).
