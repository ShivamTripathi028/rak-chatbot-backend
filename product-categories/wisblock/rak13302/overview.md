## Product Description

The RAK13302 is a LoRa module built around the Semtech SX1262 LoRa transceiver and the SKY66122 signal booster. It offers an easy-to-use, compact, and low-power solution for long-range wireless data applications.

Fully compliant with LoRaWAN standards, the RAK13302 also supports LoRa Point-to-Point (P2P) communication. It seamlessly integrates with LoRaWAN network servers, including The Things Network (TTN), ChirpStack, Actility, and more.

With its 1-watt (30dBm) signal booster, the RAK13302 is well-suited for applications that demand extended communication range.

The module is compatible with the RAK6421 RPi WisBlock HAT and WisBlock Base Boards, when used in conjunction with the RAK3401 or RAK11200 WisBlock Core module.

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK13302**, you need at least a **WisBlock Base** to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** is the connection to the MCU for the **RAK13302** module. Furthermore, you need a **WisBlock Core** module to use the sensor.

:::warning
- Due to the high power RF signal output, the module requires power either through the USB port on the WisBlock Base Board or from an external 5&nbsp;V supply voltage.    
- Use screws to keep the module firmly in place for proper operation.
