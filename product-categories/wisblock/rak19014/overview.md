## Product Description

The RAK19014 WisBlock Battery USB Power Slot Module is a modular power board comprising a battery connector (no charging circuitry onboard) and a USB Type-C connector used for reprogramming the WisBlock Core. It is designed for use with the WisBlock Base Board with Power Slot via the 40-pin WisBlock connector.

The RAK19014 is optimally designed to support very low-power applications since it only has a USB connector, battery connector, and a 3.3 V switching regulator in the circuit, removing unnecessary components that cause extra current consumption.
