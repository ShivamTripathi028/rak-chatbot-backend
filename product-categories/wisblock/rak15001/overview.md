## Product Description

The RAK15001 is a NOR flash module with a 16 MBit (2 MByte) nonvolatile memory. It uses GD25Q16CNIG (16 Mbit) from GigaDevice with standard SPI interface. In this large memory, you can save big data that your applications need to access frequently, like conversion tables, lookup tables or images, and even sound files. Compared to the EEPROM module, the RAK15001 Flash Memory module has fewer write/erase cycles, so it is not ideal as storage for constantly changing data like for sensor readings.

## Product Features

* **Sensor specifications**
    * 16 Mbit (2 MByte) capacity

    * Software/Hardware write protection
    * GigaDevice GD25Q16 chip
    * Full voltage range: **2.7~3.6 V**
    * Standby current less than 5 uA
    * Temperature range: **-40 °C to +85 °C**
    * Chipset: GigaDevice GD25Q16CNIG

* **Module Size**
    * 10 x 10 mm

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK15001**, you need at least a **WisBlock Base** to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** will provide power supply for the **RAK15001** module. Furthermore, you need a **WisBlock Core** module to use the sensor.

:::warning
Make sure to fix the module with the screws to ensure a proper function.
