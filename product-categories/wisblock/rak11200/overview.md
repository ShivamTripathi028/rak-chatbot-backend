## Product Description

**RAK11200** is a **WisBlock Core** module for RAK **WisBlock** based on Espressif ESP32-WROVER. It is a powerful, generic WiFi-BLE MCU module that targets a wide variety of applications. There are two CPU cores that can be individually controlled and the CPU clock frequency is adjustable from 80 MHz to 240 MHz. The low-power deep-sleep current consumption of the ESP32-WROVER is about 10 uA. This makes the **RAK11200** an ultra-low-power communication solution. **RAK11200** can be comfortably programmed with the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.

## Product Features

* Two low-power Xtensa® 32-bit LX6 microprocessors
* Up to 240 MHz CPU clock
* Built-in PCB antenna
* 4 MB External SPI Flash, 520 KB RAM
* 8 MB SPI Pseudo static RAM (PSRAM)
* WiFi 802.11 b/g/n (802.11n up to 150 Mbps)
* Bluetooth v4.2 BR/EDR and BLE specification
* Rich set of peripherals: RTC, UART, I2C, SPI, SD card interface
* Low-power deep-sleep mode
* Chipset: Espressif ESP32-WROVER

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK11200**, you need at least a **WisBlock Base** to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** is the power supply for the **RAK11200** module and has the programming/debug interface.

:::warning
- BOOT0 pin of ESP32 in RAK11200 must be manually connected to GND to enable Download Mode or firmware uploading procedure.
- Make sure to secure the module with the provided screws to ensure proper function.
