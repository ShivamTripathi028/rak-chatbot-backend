## Product Description

**RAK3401** is a **WisBlock Core** module for RAK **WisBlock**. It extends the **WisBlock** series with a powerful Nordic nRF52840 MCU that supports Bluetooth 5.0 (Bluetooth Low Energy). This makes the **RAK3401** an ultra-low power communication solution.
**RAK3401** can be comfortably programmed with the Arduino™ IDE or the PlatformIO extension for other IDE's like Atom, MS Visual Code, or Clion.

## Product Features

* Nordic nRF52840 ultra-low power MCU
* 32-bit ARM® Cortex™-M4 CPU
* 64 MHz CPU clock
* 1 MB Flash, 256 KB RAM
* Bluetooth 5.0 protocol stack

* I2C, SPI, Analog inputs, Digital inputs, and outputs
* Low power consumption
* Chipset: Nordic nRF52840

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK3401**, you need at least a **WisBlock Base** to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** is the power supply for the **RAK3401** module and has the programming/debug interface.

:::warning
- Make sure to fix the module with the screws to ensure a proper function.
- When using the Bluetooth Low Energy transceiver, make sure that always an antenna is connected. Using these transceivers without an antenna can damage the system.
