# RAK14007 WisBlock Interface Module Datasheet

## Overview

> **Image:** RAK14007 WisBlock Interface Module

### Description

RAK14007 is an Interface module for connecting other WisBlock modules (like RAK14013) to the WisBlock system. It has one standard WisBlock IO connector and one connector for other WisBlock modules. With RAK14007 and a cable, some of the WisBlock modules can work out of the WisBlock Base board.

### Features

- A separate joystick PCB module [RAK14013](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisblock/rak14013/overview/) is required
- One (1) available connector for RAK14013 WisBlock Joystick Module.
- Module size: 15 x 25 mm

## Specifications

### Overview

#### Mounting

The RAK14007 module can be mounted on the IO slot of the WisBlock Base board. **Figure 2** shows the mounting mechanism of the RAK14007 on a WisBlock Base board, such as the RAK5005-O.
