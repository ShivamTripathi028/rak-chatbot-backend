## Prerequisites

To use the **RAK3312**, you need at least one <a href="https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base?srsltid=AfmBOopZc6hiRouDzzO5q0m5oX1p821fsEmv8clcSIVJmJvtxjafHXqS" target="_blank">WisBlock Base</a> to plug the module into. The WisBlock Base provides power to the RAK3312 module and includes the programming and debugging interface.

:::warning
- Make sure to secure the module with screws to ensure proper functionality.
- When using the LoRa, WiFi, or BLE transceivers, make sure that an antenna is always connected. Using these transceivers without an antenna can damage the system.
