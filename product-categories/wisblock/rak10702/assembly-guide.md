# RAK10702 WisBlock Indoor Comfort Node Assembly Guide

This guide shows you step by step how to assemble the electronic components and how to assemble them in the (optional) enclosure. This guide is for the version with the 4.2" E-Ink display. If you are using the version without the display, you can skip certain steps.

## Assembly Guide

As the RAK10702 is a DIY product, this document will guide how to correctly assemble the electronic components and place them in the optional available 3D-printed enclosure.

### Assemble the Front Sensor Component RAK13013

1. Plug the Wisblock RAK1901, RAK12010 and RAK12047 on the RAK13013 sensor carrier module. Fix the modules with 3 pcs M1.2*3 Screws.
