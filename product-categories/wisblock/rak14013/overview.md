## Product Description

The RAK14013 is a joystick module with embedded MCU based on ATTINY441-SSU from Atmel. It has four common tactile push buttons and a rotary 2-axis analog joystick. The status of the buttons and voltage readings of an analog joystick is monitored by the MCU and converted to digital data via I2C interface. RAK14013 doesn't have a WisBlock standard connector so you need a RAK14007 adapter board to plug it into to WisBlock Base module. The RAK14013 communicates to the WisBlock Core via I2C interface.
