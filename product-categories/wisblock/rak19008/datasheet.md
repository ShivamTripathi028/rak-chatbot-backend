# RAK19008 WisBlock IO Extension Cable Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The RAK19008 is a **WisBlock IO Extension Cable** used to position WisBlock IO modules apart from the WisBlock Base board. This helps to eliminate the influence of other WisBlock modules from sensors that measure environmental data. The advantage of using RAK19008 is to enable the design of a new enclosure that exposes IO Slot directly to the environment without problems.

### Features

* 120 mm length FPC (Flat Printed Circuit) board
* All signals of the 40-pin Slot connector are available
* Compatible with many WisBlock Base Board with 40-pin WisConnector
* Easy click and use application

## Specifications

### Overview

#### Mounting

The RAK19008 **WisBlock IO Extension Cable** must be mounted on 40-pin IO Slot of a WisBlock Base Board. The other end of the cable must be plugged into a WisBlock module with 40-pin IO Slot.
