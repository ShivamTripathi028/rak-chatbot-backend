## Product Description

The RAK19008 is a **WisBlock IO Extension Cable** used to position WisBlock IO modules apart from the WisBlock Base Board. This helps to eliminate the influence of other WisBlock modules from sensors that measure environmental data. The advantage of using RAK19008 is to enable the design of a new enclosure that exposes WisBlock IO slot directly to the environment without problems.

## Product Features

* 120 mm length FPC (Flat Printed Circuit) board
* All signals of the 40-pin IO Slot connector are available
* Compatible with WisBlock Base Board with 40-pin IO WisConnector
* Easy click and use application

## Prerequisites

To use the **RAK19008 WisBlock IO Extension Cable**, you need a [WisBlock Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisblock#wisblock-base) to plug the extension in. The other end of the cable must be plugged into a WisBlock module with 40-pin IO Slot. Also, you need a [WisBlock Core](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisblock#wisblock-core) to control your module.
