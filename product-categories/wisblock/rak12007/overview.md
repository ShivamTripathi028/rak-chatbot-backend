## Product Description

RAK12007 is an ultrasonic sensor module based on the CS100, an industrial-grade ultrasonic distance measurement chip. This chip integrates an ultrasonic transmitter, ultrasonic receiver, and digital processing circuits. The distance measurement result output is in the form of the pulse width.

For an ultrasonic detector, there are two main parts: **Emitter** and **Detector**. The emitter transmits an ultrasonic sound wave, and the detector receives back the signal from the emitter reflected by an object. By calculating the travel time and the speed of sound, the distance of the object can be determined.

## Product Features

* **Sensor specifications**

    * Detect range 2&nbsp;cm to 4&nbsp;m
    * 3.3&nbsp;V power supply
    * Standby Current: < 170&nbsp;uA
    * Chipset: angoSense CS100

* **Size**
    * 25 x 48&nbsp;mm

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK12007**, you need at least a **WisBlock Base** to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** provides power supply to the **RAK12007** module. Furthermore, you need a **WisBlock Core** module to develop your application for the **RAK12007** sensor module.

:::warning
Make sure to fix the module with the screws to ensure a proper function.
