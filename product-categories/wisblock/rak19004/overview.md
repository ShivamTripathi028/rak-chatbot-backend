## Product Description

RAK19004 is a WisBlock Power module that can harness and convert green power such as wind power, hydroelectric power, or solar power into fixed 5 V output. The module uses a TPS55165-Q1 from Texas Instruments, which is a DC-DC buck-boost converter. Upon startup, the module can have a stable 5 V output from a varying input voltage of 2 V-36 V, and its output current can also be as high as 1 A.

:::tip NOTE
- The module has a minimum input voltage of 5.3 V upon startup.
- RAK19004 doesn't have a WisConnector just like the other WisBlock modules. But it is an external module with four (4) mounting holes, so you can place the module in the position that you want.
