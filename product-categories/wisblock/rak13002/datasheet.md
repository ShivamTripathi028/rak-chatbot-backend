# RAK13002 WisBlock IO Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The RAK13002 is a WisBlock Core adaptor module that can be mounted to the IO slot of the WisBlock Base board. This module exposed all WisBlock Core signals such as I2C, SPI, UART, GPIO, and ADC to standard 2.54 mm pitch pin header for easy integration of external components and devices.

### Features

- Supports two I2C interfaces
- Supports two UART interfaces
- Supports one SPI interface
- Supports up to six (6) GPIOs
- Supports two (2) ADC interfaces
- 3.3 V power supply  interfaces
- Backup battery (super cap) can keep the RTC running for up to 7 days (tested in lab)
- Module size: 25X35 mm
