## Product Description

**RAK12052** is a 32 x 24 thermal IR array module based on MLX90640 from Melexis. MLX90640 is a fully-calibrated 32 x 24 pixels thermal IR array in an industry-standard 4-lead TO39 package with a digital interface, and it contains 768 FIR pixels. An ambient sensor is integrated to measure the ambient temperature of the chip and a supply sensor to measure the VDD. The outputs of all sensors IR, Ta, and VDD are stored in internal RAM and accessible through I2C. It is comparable in having a thermal camera (or Predator's vision) but in compact but useable low resolution.

## Product Features

**Module Specifications**
- Easy to integrate
- Factory calibrated
- Noise Equivalent Temperature Difference (NETD) 0.1K RMS @ 1 Hz refresh rate
- I2C compatible digital interface
- FOV options – 55° x 35°
- Current consumption less than 23 mA
- Power Supply：3.3 V
- Operating Temperature: -40° C ~ 80° C

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK12052**, you need a **WisBlock Base** board to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** board provides power supply to the **RAK12052** module. Furthermore, you need the **WisBlock Core** module to use the RAK12052.
