# RAK19001 WisBlock Dual IO Base Board Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

**RAK19001** is a **WisBlock Base** board that connects **WisBlock Core** and **WisBlock Modules**. It provides the power supply and interconnection to the modules attached to it. It has one slot reserved for the WisBlock Core module, two IO slots, and six sensor slots A to F for WisBlock Modules. Also, there are two **2.54 mm pitch headers** that expose all key input-output pins of the WisBlock Core that includes UART, I2C, SPI, and many IO Pins.

For convenience, there is a Type-C USB connector that is connected directly to WisBlock Core MCU’s USB port (if supported) or to a USB-UART converter depending on the WisBlock Core. The USB-C connection can be used for uploading firmware, serial communication, and charging A rechargeable battery. RAK19001 also includes a slide switch to select between rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries.

WisBlock Modules are connected to the RAK19001 WisBlock Base board via **high-speed board-to-board connectors**. They provide secure and reliable interconnection to ensure the signal integrity of each data bus. A set of screws are used for fixing the modules, which makes it reliable even in an environment with lots of vibrations.

Additionally, it has two user-definable LEDs, one power supply/charging indicator LED, and one user-defined button.

If you can't find a module that fits your IoT requirements, use the standard connectors of WisBlock to develop your own specific function module. WisBlock supports open-source hardware architecture and you can find tutorials showing how to create your own [Awesome WisBlock](https://github.com/RAKWireless/Awesome-WisBlock) module.

##### J10 and J15 Headers (Core IO Pins)

On the WisBlock Dual IO Base board, there are a total of 40 2.54 mm pitch headers for IO access and extension. These IO pins are distributed to J10 and J15 pin headers with the corresponding label at the back of the board. The arrangement of the pins is based on the [40-pin WisConnector of the WisBlock Core](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisblock/rak19001/datasheet/#connector-for-wisblock-core).

:::tip NOTE
BOOT pin is used on startup configuration or sequence of the WisBlock Core connected to it. It is commonly used for uploading the bootloader and/or application firmware. The requirements of the state of the BOOT pin depend on the specific model of the WisBlock Core used.

##### Connector for WisBlock IO Slot

The WisBlock Module IO Slot connector, as shown in **Figure 13**, is a 40-pin board-to-board connector.

:::tip NOTE
The two WisBlock 40-pin connectors have the same connections for all IO, signal, and serial pins (UART, SPI, I2C).

#### Electrical Characteristics

##### Absolute Maximum Ratings

The Absolute Maximum Ratings of the device are shown in the table below. The stress ratings are the functional operation of the device.

:::warning

1. If the stress rating goes above what is listed, it may cause permanent damage to the device.
2. Exposure to maximum rating conditions may affect the device reliability.
   :::

| Ratings                                 | Maximum Value   | Unit |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---- |
| Power Supply on the USB port (**VBUS**) | –0.3 to 5.5     | V    |
| Battery Voltage (**VBAT**)              | –0.3 to 4.3     | V    |
| Solar Panel Voltage (**CONN_S**)        | –0.3 to 5.5     | V    |
| IOs of WisConnector                     | –0.3 to VDD+0.3 | V    |
| ESD                                     | 2000            | V    |

:::tip NOTE
The RAK19001, as any electronic equipment, is sensitive to **electrostatic discharge (ESD)**. Improper handling can cause permanent damage to the module.
:::

##### Current Consumption

The RAK19001 is designed for **low-power IoT products**. Its power supply uses a high-efficiency low ground current regulator. When there is no module on RAK19001, the **leakage current is lower than 2 µA**. With WisBlock Core and WisBlock sensor on it, the sleep current is **lower than 10 µA**. When a LoRa module is transmitting, the current may reach **130 mA**.

| **Conditions**                                               | **Current** | **Unit** |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | -------- |
| Leakage current, without any module on RAK19001              | 2           | µA       |
| Idle current, with WisBlock Core and WisBlock Modules in sleep mode | 10          | µA       |
| Working current, with LoRa module transmitting               | 130         | mA       |

##### Rechargeable Battery Connector

The RAK19001 WisBlock Base Board can be powered by a rechargeable battery connected to the **P1 connector**. The nominal operating voltage of the battery should be within the range shown in the following table. The matching connector for the battery wires is an [JST PHR-2 2 mm pitch female](https://www.jst-mfg.com/product/detail_e.php?series=199)

| **Minimum** | **Typical** | **Maximum** | **Unit** |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 3.3         | 3.7         | 4.3         | V        |

If a rechargeable battery is used, the USB connector is used as a charging port. The voltage and current fed to the battery through the port should not exceed its charging limits, as shown in the table below.

| **Parameter**    | **Value**        |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Charging Voltage | 4.5 – 5.5 V |
| Charging Current | 500 mA      |

A suitable Li-Ion battery should have the following parameters as shown in the table below:

| **Parameter**     | **Value**            |
| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Standard Voltage  | 3.7 V           |
| Charging Voltage  | 4.2 V           |
| Capacity          | As required          |
| Discharge current | At least 500 mA |

##### Non-Rechargeable Battery Connector

The RAK19001 WisBlock Base Board can be powered by a Non-rechargeable battery connected to the **P3 connector**. The nominal operating voltage of the battery should be within the range shown in the following table. The matching connector for the battery wires is an

| **Minimum** | **Typical** | **Maximum** | **Unit** |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 3.3         | 3.7         | 5.5         | V        |

##### Solar Panel Connector

A 5 V solar panel can be connected to the board via the **P2 connector** to also serve the purpose of charging the battery. The matching connector for the solar panel wires is an [JST ZHR-2 1.5 mm pitch female](https://www.jst-mfg.com/product/detail_e.php?series=287)
