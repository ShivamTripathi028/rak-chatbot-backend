## Product Description

**RAK12022** is a PT100 IO module that uses **MAX31865**, an easy-to-use resistance-to-digital converter optimized for platinum resistance temperature detectors (RTDs). An external resistor sets the sensitivity for the RTD being used and a precision delta-sigma ADC converts the ratio of the RTD resistance to the reference resistance into digital form. The MAX31865’s inputs are protected against overvoltage faults as large as 45 V. Programmable detection of RTD and cable open and short conditions is included.

## Product Features

**Module specifications**
- Based on MCP2518FD and ATA6563
- Compatible with 2-wire, 3-wire, and 4-wire sensor connections
- SPI-Compatible Interface
- 15-Bit ADC Resolution; Nominal Temperature Resolution 0.03125 NC (Varies Due to RTD Nonlinearity)
- Total Accuracy Over All Operating Conditions: 0.5 NC (0.05% of Full Scale) max
- Fully Differential VREF Inputs
- 21 ms (max) Conversion Time
- Power supply: 3.3 V
- Operating Temperature: -40° C ~ 85° C

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK12022**, you need a **WisBlock Base** board to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** board provides power supply to the **RAK12022** module. Furthermore, you need the **WisBlock Core** module to use the RAK12022.

:::warning
Make sure to fix the module with screws to ensure proper function.
