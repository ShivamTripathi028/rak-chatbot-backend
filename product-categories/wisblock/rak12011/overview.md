## Product Description

The RAK12011 is a Barometric Pressure sensor module that is part of the RAKWireless WisBlock Sensor series. It uses an LPS33HW MEMS sensor from STMicroelectronics with both barometric pressure and temperature data obtainable via an I2C interface. The pressure sensor has a water-resistant package and is combined with the three-proof paint in the RAK12011 PCB. This makes the module ideal on a barometric air pressure data acquisition system even in an environment prone to water exposure.
