## Product Description

RAK12037 is a WisBlock Sensor that extends the WisBlock system based on the SCD30 module. This module uses NDIR CO2 sensor technology to sense CO2 and has an integrated temperature and humidity sensor. Ambient humidity and temperature can be measured by monitoring and compensating for external heat sources without the need for additional components. The small module height allows easy integration into different applications. The SCD30 features dual-channel detection for superior stability and ±30ppm + 3% accuracy.
