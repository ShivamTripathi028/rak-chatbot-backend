## Product Description

The RAK12001 is a fingerprint sensor module based on GROW R307. This module supports both fingerprint enrollment and fingerprint matching. When enrolling, it is required to place the finger two times in the sensor. The system will process the fingerprint images collected and generate a template, then store the fingerprint template in its memory. When matching, the sensor will determine if the finger placed in its optical sensor has a match on its memory.
