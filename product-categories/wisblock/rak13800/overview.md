## Product Description

RAK13800 is an Ethernet module based on the W5100S-L chip from WIZnet. The module has an embedded Internet Controller Chip that integrates a Hardwired TCP/IP stack with 10/100 Ethernet MAC and PHY. It is truly a one-chip solution for stable internet connectivity.

The RAK13800 TCP/IP stack supports TCP, UDP, IPv4, ICMP, ARP, IGMP, and PPPoE – and it has been proven through various applications over the last decade.

The user can develop an Ethernet application easily by using the simple SOCKETs program instead of handling a complex Ethernet controller. W5100S-L provides four independent SOCKETs to be used simultaneously and 16 KB internal memory for RX/TX data communication buffer.

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK13800**, you need to connect the module to the IO slot of a **WisBlock Base** Board. The **WisBlock Base** is the power supply for the **RAK13800** module. Furthermore, you need a **WisBlock Core** module, to control the module via software code.
:::warning
Make sure to fix the module with the screws to ensure a proper function.
