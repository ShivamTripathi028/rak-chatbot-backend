## Product Description

The RAK12034 is a 9-axis accelerometer module, part of the RAKwireless WisBlock Sensor series. It is based on BMX160 Bosch Sensor, which is a highly integrated low-power 9-axis sensor providing precise acceleration, angular rate, and geomagnetic measurement in each spatial direction.

Due to its small form factor and low-power consumption, it is ideal for smart wearables. Moreover, you can also use the BSX sensor data fusion software library of Bosch Sensortec to tweak the sensor's performance.

## Product Features

* **Module Specifications**
- Based on Bosch BMX160
- Very low power consumption: typ. 1585 μA in high performance mode
- Selectable acceleration range: ±2 g to ±16 g
- Gyroscope range: 125 °/s to 2000 °/s
- Magnetic field range x/y ±1300 μT, z ±2500 μT
- 3.3 V Power supply
- Operating temperature: -40 °C ~ 105 °C

* **Module Size**
    * 10 mm x 10 mm

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK12034**, you need at least a **WisBlock Base** to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** is the power supply for the **RAK12034** module. Furthermore, you need a **WisBlock Core** module to use the sensor.

:::warning
Make sure to fix the module with the screws to ensure a proper function.
