## Product Description

The RAK1902 WisBlock Barometer Pressure Sensor Module, part of the RAK Wireless WisBlock series, is an ultra-compact piezo-resistive pressure sensor that functions as a digital barometer with an I2C interface. The sensing element, which detects absolute pressure, consists of a suspended membrane manufactured through a delicate process developed by ST®. The pressure measurement covers the range from 260 hPa to 1260 hPa and the temperature measurement covers the range from -40 °C to 85 °C. Measurements accuracy is ±0.1 hPa for pressure and ±1.5 °C for temperature.
