## Product Description

The **RAK8212 WisTrio iTracker Pro** is a versatile developer board aimed at aiding in quick prototypes using NB-IoT. The board includes a vast array of connectivity options like **NB-IoT**, **Bluetooth 5.0** and **GPS** and sensors like an **accelerometer**, **light sensor** and **barometric sensor**. At the heart of the module is the venerable **Nordic NRF52832 BLE** processor. The NB-IoT connectivity is provided by the **Quectel BG96 module**. The RAK8212 module is **Arduino friendly** and can be programmed using the IDE.

The board also provides **SWD interface** for programming the **NRF52832** core. The combination of BLE and NB-IoT provides flexible low power consumption development along with myriad of application option ranging from telemetry to live tracking and environment sensing.

Applications can be made with the RAK8212 like Vehicle location/fleet transportation management, Safety monitoring of minor children, Animal protection and animal husbandry management, Loss of assets / personnel positioning and Other remote, battery powered applications.
